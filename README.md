# Improving the Editor Experience Through Validation

Wagtail leverages Django's powerful model validation system to make it easy to check for things like required fields being filled or URLs being entered in the correct format, but did you know that it's easy to write your own validation logic to make your site more predictable for both you and your editors? This talk will do a survey of a number of common (and less common!) custom validation scenarios that you may want to incorporate into your projects.
